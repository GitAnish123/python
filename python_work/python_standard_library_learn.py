"""
The Python standard library is a set of modules included with every Python installation. 
Now that you have a basic understanding of how functions and classes work, 
you can start to use modules like these that other programmers have written. 
You can use any function or class in the standard library by including a simple import statement at the top of your file. 
Let's look at one module, random, which can be useful in modeling many real-world situations.
One interesting function from the random module is randint(). 
This function takes two integer arguments and returns a randomly selected integer between (and including) those numbers.
"""
# Hereâ€™s how to generate a random number between 1 and 6:

from random import randint   # Importing the function from the module
print(randint(1,6))          # Generates a random integer between 1-6



# Another useful function is "choice()". This function takes in a list or tuple and returns a randomly chosen element:
from random import choice
players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
first_up = choice(players)
print(first_up.title())



"""
The random module shouldn't be used when building security-related applications, 
but it works well for many fun and interesting projects.
"""
# These are some examples that are inside the Python Standard Library. There are SO MANY more modules/functions to explore.

"""
NOTE:
You can also download modules from external sources. 
You'll see a number of these examples, where we'll need external modules to complete each project.
