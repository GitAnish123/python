# Lets learn to modify functions!
# Learn more in notes or in crash course!
# Here is an example without functions with 3D Models!




# Start with some designs that need to be printed.

    Simulate printing each design, until none are left.

# You can also send a copy to a function so when you modify it, the function will not change its elements inside.
# This will work for "unprinted_designs" in the function, "print_models" in this example. For example:

    Simulate printing each design, until none are left.
    Move each design to completed_models after printing.
    """

# That is an example of how you do it!
